#### Overview:

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for uploading and managing photos. It consists of a backend built with Node.js and Express for handling photo uploads and data storage, and a frontend built with React using Vite as a build tool for managing UI components and interactions.

#### Features:

1. **Upload Photos:** Users can upload photos along with their titles and descriptions.
2. **View Photos:** Users can view uploaded photos along with their details.
3. **Edit Photos:** Users can edit photo titles and descriptions.
4. **Delete Photos:** Users can delete uploaded photos.

#### Backend (Node.js + Express):

- **Routes:** Define routes for handling CRUD operations for photos.
- **Controllers:** Implement controllers to handle logic for CRUD operations.
- **Middleware:** Implement middleware for handling file uploads and validation.
- **Data Storage:** Store photo data in a database (e.g., MongoDB) or filesystem.

#### Frontend (React + Vite):

- **UI Components:** Create UI components for displaying photos, forms for uploading and editing photos.
- **State Management:** Manage application state using React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) or context API.
- **API Integration:** Integrate with backend API endpoints for fetching, uploading, updating, and deleting photos.

#### Technologies:

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite, React Router
- **Database:** MongoDB (optional)
- **Styling:** CSS, CSS Modules, or CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., styled-components)

#### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install backend and frontend dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. **Setup Backend:** Configure backend environment variables and database connection (if using MongoDB).
4. **Run Backend:** Start the backend server.
5. **Setup Frontend:** Configure frontend environment variables (if any).
6. **Run Frontend:** Start the frontend development server.
7. **Access Application:** Access the application in the web browser at the specified URL.

#### Development Road

- **Phase 1:** Setup basic CRUD functionality for photos.
- **Phase 2:** Implement user authentication and authorization.
- **Phase 3:** Enhance UI/UX with advanced features like pagination, search, and filtering.
- **Phase 4:** Deploy the application to a production environment.
